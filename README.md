## Purpose
This test will allow you take a timd assessment of your fundamental JS knowledge. It will add ten points for every question that is answered correctly and it will subtract 10 seconds for every missed question. It will also allow you to save your scores to track improvement. 

## Challenges 
The only big hold up I faced was accessing the class of the submission button at the end of the quiz. I tried so many different ways to access the button I was creating and ultimately decided just to show and hide a new button that exists on the page ahead of time.
